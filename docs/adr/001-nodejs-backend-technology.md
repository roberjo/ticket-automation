# ADR-001: Node.js Backend Technology Selection

## Status

**Accepted** - 2024-12-31

## Context

The ServiceNow Ticket Automation project requires a backend technology that can efficiently handle:
- REST API development for frontend communication
- ServiceNow API integration with custom Scripted REST API
- Okta OAuth 2.0 authentication and JWT validation
- Database operations for storing ticket requests and status tracking
- Multi-ticket creation from single user requests
- Real-time status polling and updates
- Comprehensive testing and deployment capabilities

The frontend is already decided to use React 18 with TypeScript, and we need to choose between Node.js and Python for the backend technology.

## Decision

**We will use Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript for the backend technology.**

## Rationale

### 1. Language Consistency and Developer Experience

**Node.js provides seamless JavaScript/TypeScript integration** between frontend and backend:
- Shared type definitions using TypeScript
- Code reuse for validation logic and utilities
- Consistent development patterns and tooling
- Single language expertise requirement for the development team
- Easier debugging and development workflow

### 2. API Development Strengths

**Node.js excels at REST API development**:
- Express.js provides excellent routing and middleware capabilities
- Built-in async/await support for handling concurrent requests
- Native JSON handling without serialization overhead
- Rich middleware ecosystem for authentication, validation, logging, and security
- Excellent HTTP client libraries (axios, node-fetch) for ServiceNow integration

### 3. ServiceNow Integration Advantages

**Node.js provides optimal tools for ServiceNow integration**:
- Strong HTTP client libraries with built-in retry and error handling
- Native JWT handling with libraries like `jsonwebtoken`
- Excellent OAuth 2.0 support for Okta integration
- Easy implementation of rate limiting for ServiceNow API constraints
- Efficient handling of multiple concurrent API calls

### 4. Performance Benefits

**Node.js offers superior performance for this use case**:
- Event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture
- Efficient handling of multiple concurrent requests
- Lower memory footprint compared to Python for web applications
- Fast startup time for development iteration
- Excellent performance for JSON-heavy API workloads

### 5. Development Velocity

**Node.js ecosystem accelerates development**:
- Vast npm ecosystem with packages for every requirement
- Hot reloading capabilities for fast development feedback
- Excellent TypeScript support with strong IDE integration
- Comprehensive testing tools (Jest, Supertest) that work seamlessly
- Strong community support and documentation

### 6. Database Integration

**Node.js provides excellent database integration options**:
- TypeORM and Prisma offer excellent TypeScript integration
- Strong PostgreSQL support with connection pooling
- Efficient query building and migration management
- Type-safe database operations with TypeScript

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Faster Development**: Single language stack reduces context switching
2. **Better Code Sharing**: Shared types and utilities between frontend and backend
3. **Improved Performance**: Event-driven architecture handles concurrent requests efficiently
4. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Consistent tooling and debugging capabilities
5. **Strong Ecosystem**: Rich library ecosystem for all project requirements
6. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support across the entire stack

### Negative Consequences

1. **Learning Curve**: Team members unfamiliar with Node.js will need training
2. **Callback Complexity**: Async programming patterns may be complex for some developers
3. **Memory Management**: Requires careful attention to memory leaks in long-running processes
4. **CPU-Intensive Tasks**: Less suitable for CPU-intensive operations (not relevant for this project)

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Training**: Provide Node.js and TypeScript training for team members
2. **Code Reviews**: Implement strict code review processes for async patterns
3. **Monitoring**: Use proper monitoring tools to detect memory issues
4. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for async patterns

## Alternatives Considered

### Python (Django/Flask)

**Pros:**
- Mature web frameworks with excellent documentation
- Strong data processing capabilities
- Excellent for complex business logic
- Good for machine learning integration (future consideration)

**Cons:**
- Language switching between frontend and backend
- More complex async patterns with asyncio
- Generally slower performance for web API workloads
- More complex deployment and containerization
- JSON handling requires serialization/deserialization

### Java (Spring Boot)

**Pros:**
- Enterprise-grade framework with excellent tooling
- Strong typing and compile-time safety
- Excellent for complex business logic
- Mature ecosystem and community

**Cons:**
- Significant language switching from JavaScript/TypeScript
- Higher memory footprint and slower startup times
- More verbose code compared to Node.js
- Overkill for this specific use case
- Longer development cycles

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Set up Node.js project with Express.js and TypeScript
- Configure development environment and tooling
- Implement basic project structure and routing
- Set up Okta JWT validation middleware

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-4)
- Implement ServiceNow API integration
- Create database models and migrations
- Develop multi-ticket creation logic
- Implement status tracking and polling

### Phase 3: Testing and Deployment (Week 5-6)
- Implement comprehensive testing suite
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Configure production deployment
- Performance optimization and monitoring
