- **Individual mock documentation**: Explains each mocked API and its purpose
- **Configuration documentation**: Explains mock behavior and usage

**Example Comment Structure**:
```typescript
/**
 * Mock window.matchMedia
 * 
 * This API is used by CSS media queries and responsive design libraries.
 * In the Node.js test environment, this API doesn't exist, so we need to mock it.
 * 
 * The mock provides:
 * - matches: Boolean indicating if the media query matches
 * - media: The media query string
 * - Event listener methods for media query changes
 * - Both modern and deprecated API methods for compatibility
 */
```

### 4. `frontend/src/test/utils.tsx`

**Purpose**: Provides common utilities, mock data, and helper functions for testing.

**Key Features Documented**:
- **Custom Render Function**: Enhanced render with all necessary providers
- **Test Data Factories**: Consistent test data across all tests
- **Mock API Responses**: Realistic API response data for testing
- **Helper Functions**: Utility functions for common testing patterns

**Comment Structure**:
- **File-level documentation**: Explains purpose and usage patterns
- **Function documentation**: Explains each utility function and its parameters
- **Data structure documentation**: Explains mock data organization and purpose

**Example Comment Structure**:
```typescript
/**
 * Test User Data Factory
 * 
 * Provides consistent test user data across all tests.
 * Each user has different roles and permissions for testing
 * role-based access control and user-specific functionality.
 * 
 * User Types:
 * - admin: Full system access and administrative privileges
 * - manager: Team management and approval capabilities
 * - user: Basic user access and task management
 */
```

## Comment Standards and Patterns

### 1. File-Level Documentation

Every test file includes comprehensive file-level documentation that explains:
- **Purpose**: What the file tests and why
- **Structure**: How tests are organized
- **Approach**: Testing methodology and patterns used
- **Dependencies**: What the tests depend on

### 2. Test Suite Documentation

Each major test suite (describe block) includes documentation explaining:
- **Scope**: What functionality is being tested
- **Categories**: Different types of tests within the suite
- **Purpose**: Why this functionality needs testing

### 3. Individual Test Documentation

Each test case includes detailed documentation explaining:
- **Purpose**: What specific behavior is being tested
- **Steps**: The logical flow of the test
- **Expected Outcome**: What should happen when the test passes
- **Business Value**: Why this test is important

### 4. Inline Comments

Code sections include inline comments that explain:
- **Setup**: What data or state is being prepared
- **Actions**: What operations are being performed
- **Assertions**: What is being verified and why
- **Edge Cases**: Special considerations or conditions

## Benefits of Detailed Comments

### 1. **Maintainability**
- New developers can quickly understand test purpose and logic
- Changes to functionality can be easily mapped to affected tests
- Test failures provide clear context about what was being tested

### 2. **Documentation**
- Tests serve as living documentation of component behavior
- Business requirements are clearly expressed in test descriptions
- API contracts and data structures are documented through test data

### 3. **Debugging**
- Failed tests provide clear context about expected behavior
- Test setup and teardown logic is clearly explained
- Mock data and API responses are documented for troubleshooting

### 4. **Onboarding**
- New team members can understand testing patterns quickly
- Test structure and organization is clearly explained
- Common testing utilities and helpers are documented

## Testing Patterns Documented

### 1. **Store Testing Pattern**
```typescript
// Setup: Reset store state before each test
beforeEach(() => {
  authStore.logout();
});

// Test: Validate state changes
it('should login user', () => {
  // Arrange: Create test data
  const testUser = { /* user data */ };
  
  // Act: Execute the action
  authStore.login(testUser);
  
  // Assert: Verify state changes
  expect(authStore.activeUser).toEqual(testUser);
  expect(authStore.isAuthenticated).toBe(true);
});
```

### 2. **Component Testing Pattern**
```typescript
// Setup: Prepare test environment
const testUser = { /* user data */ };
authStore.login(testUser);

// Render: Component with providers
render(
  <TestWrapper>
    <Dashboard />
  </TestWrapper>
);

// Assert: Verify rendered content
expect(screen.getByText(/Welcome back/)).toBeInTheDocument();
```

### 3. **Role-Based Testing Pattern**
```typescript
// Test different user roles
it('should show admin-specific content for admin users', () => {
  // Arrange: Login as admin
  authStore.login(adminUser);
  
  // Act: Render component
  render(<TestWrapper><Dashboard /></TestWrapper>);
  
  // Assert: Verify admin content
  expect(screen.getByText(/System Overview/)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## Quality Assurance
