# ServiceNow Ticket Automation Project - Testing Strategy

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the ServiceNow Ticket Automation Project. The goal is to ensure the system functions correctly, meets user requirements, and is reliable and secure. We will employ a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

## 2. Testing Levels

Unit Testing: Testing individual components (functions, modules, classes) in isolation to verify their correct behavior. This will be primarily done on the frontend (React components, MobX stores, utility functions) and the backend (API handlers, service layer, data access layer). Jest will be the primary framework for unit testing.

Integration Testing: Testing the interactions between different parts of the system, such as the frontend communicating with the backend API, and the backend communicating with the ServiceNow API and the database. We will use Jest and React Testing Library for frontend integration tests and Jest for backend integration tests, potentially using mocking for external dependencies like the ServiceNow API.

End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Optional - Future Consideration): Simulating real user scenarios, testing the entire application flow from the user interface to the ServiceNow ticket creation and status update. This might be considered in later phases using tools like Cypress or Playwright.

## 3. Test Scope

Frontend Testing:

Component rendering and interaction.

State management logic (MobX stores and actions).

Form validation.

API service calls and response handling (mocked).

Authentication flow (mocked Okta interactions).

Backend Testing:

API endpoint functionality (request handling, response codes).

Business logic within service layers.

Database interactions (mocked database).

ServiceNow API communication (mocked ServiceNow API).

Authentication and authorization logic.

ServiceNow Integration Testing:

Verification that the backend can successfully create tickets via the custom Scripted REST API in a test ServiceNow environment.

Verification that the backend can retrieve ticket statuses from ServiceNow.

## 4. Test Environment

Development Environment: Developers will run unit and integration tests locally during development.

Test Environment: A dedicated test environment that closely mirrors the production environment will be used for more comprehensive integration testing, including interaction with a test ServiceNow instance.

## 5. Test Data Management

Test data will be carefully managed to ensure consistent and repeatable test results. Mock data and a dedicated test ServiceNow environment will be used.

## 6. Test Automation

Whenever possible, tests will be automated to ensure efficiency and consistency.

Unit and integration tests will be integrated into the development workflow and the CI/CD pipeline.

## 7. Test Reporting

Test results will be reported clearly to the development team. The CI/CD pipeline will provide feedback on the status of each build based on the test results.

## 8. Responsibilities

Developers: Responsible for writing and maintaining unit and integration tests for the code they develop.

QA/Testing Team (if applicable): Responsible for designing and executing more comprehensive integration and potentially end-to-end tests, as well as exploratory testing.

## 9. Tools and Technologies

Jest: Primary testing framework for both frontend and backend.

React Testing Library: For testing React components by focusing on user behavior.

Mocking Libraries: Jest's built-in mocking, msw (Mock Service Worker), or similar tools for mocking API calls and external dependencies.

ESLint and Prettier: For code linting and style enforcement, ensuring code quality and consistency.

GitHub Actions: For running tests automatically in the CI/CD pipeline.
